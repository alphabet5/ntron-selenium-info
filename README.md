# ntron-selenium-info
 Gather information from ntron access points using selenium.
 
 Selenium is used as the pages data fields are populated with javascript and requests does not load the values.
 
 This is specific for fetching information from N-Tron 702-W wireless radios. I'm sorry if you ever have to use these.
